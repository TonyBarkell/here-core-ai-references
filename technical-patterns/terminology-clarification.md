# Terminology Clarification Guide

## Common Customer Terminology Confusion

### Views vs Windows
**Customer Says:** "Multiple views"
**Default Assumption:** Views within the same window (Golden Layout style)
**Clarification Required:** Always confirm if they mean:
- Views within one window (most common)
- Separate windows each containing views
- Mix of both patterns

**Customer Says:** "Multiple windows"
**Default Assumption:** Separate windows, each potentially containing multiple views
**Clarification Required:** Confirm:
- Each window content structure
- Inter-window communication requirements
- Window management expectations

### Multiple View Creation Method (NEW)
**Customer Says:** "Create multiple views" or "Test view opening times"
**Critical Decision:** Choose between layout restore vs sequential creation
**Clarification Required:** Always ask:
- "Are you testing performance of view opening times?" â†’ **Use Layout Restore**
- "Do all views have similar content/configuration?" â†’ **Use Layout Restore**
- "Do views need individual timing/configuration?" â†’ **Use Sequential Creation**
- "Are you testing memory usage with multiple views?" â†’ **Use Layout Restore**

**Performance Impact:**
- **Layout Restore**: All views created simultaneously (faster, realistic)
- **Sequential Creation**: Views created one-by-one (slower, individual control)

### Platform API Terminology
**Customer Says:** "Platform"
**Could Mean:**
- HEREÂ® Core Container runtime
- Platform API for window/view management
- Custom platform provider
**Always Clarify:** Which platform component they're referring to

### Application vs View Terminology
**Customer Says:** "Application"
**Could Mean:**
- Entire HEREÂ® Core Container application
- Individual view within a window
- Separate application in the runtime
**Always Clarify:** Scope and boundaries of what they call "application"

## Mandatory Clarification Questions

### Before Creating Any Sample:
1. **"When you say \"multiple views\", do you mean views within the same window or separate windows?"**
2. **"Are you using a custom platform provider or the default provider?"**
3. **"What should the user see and interact with in this reproduction?"**
4. **"Which APIs are you expecting to use: Platform, Application, Interop, or System?"**

### For Multiple View Scenarios (ENHANCED):
5. **"Are you testing performance/timing of view creation?"**
   - If YES: "Would you prefer layout restore (faster) or user-selectable methods?"
6. **"Do all views have similar content?"**
   - If YES: "Layout restore would be efficient - or would you like user choice?"
7. **"Do you need individual control over each view creation?"** â†’ Sequential Creation
8. **"Would you like to compare both creation methods?"** â†’ User-Selectable UI
9. **"Are you researching the performance difference?"** â†’ User-Selectable UI

### For Complex Scenarios:
9. **"Should this demonstrate the problem or the expected solution?"**
10. **"What specific behavior should I reproduce vs what should work correctly?"**
11. **"Are there any customer-specific configurations I should avoid?"**

## Decision Tree: Multiple View Creation

```
Customer mentions "multiple views"
â”œâ”€â”€ Clear performance testing? â†’ Layout Restore
â”œâ”€â”€ Clear individual control needed? â†’ Sequential Creation
â”œâ”€â”€ Educational/comparison purpose? â†’ User-Selectable UI
â”œâ”€â”€ Ambiguous requirements? â†’ Ask Prompter
â”œâ”€â”€ Different configurations? â†’ Sequential Creation
â”œâ”€â”€ Research/demo purpose? â†’ User-Selectable UI
â””â”€â”€ Uncertain? â†’ Ask: "Layout restore, sequential, or user choice?"
```

## Sample Prompter Consultation

### When AI Should Ask Prompter:
```markdown
ðŸ¤” **Method Selection Needed**

For your multiple view scenario, I can implement:

**Option 1: Layout Restore**
- âœ… Faster (simultaneous creation)
- âœ… Better for performance testing
- âœ… More realistic timing measurements

**Option 2: Sequential Creation**
- âœ… Individual control over each view
- âœ… Different configurations per view
- âœ… Controlled timing between creations

**Option 3: User-Selectable (Recommended for demos)**
- âœ… Buttons to try both methods
- âœ… Side-by-side performance comparison
- âœ… Educational value for understanding differences

Which approach would be most helpful for your use case?
