# API Discoveries and Patterns

## Log of Technical Patterns Discovered

*Update this file as new patterns are discovered during sample creation*

### Entry Template:
```markdown
### [DATE] - [TECHNICAL_PATTERN_NAME]
**API Focus:** [Primary fin API involved]
**Issue Pattern:** [Brief technical description]
**Solution Pattern:** [How it was resolved]
**Code Pattern:** [Key code structure that worked]
**Reusability:** [How this applies to similar issues]
**Reference Added:** [Which reference file was updated]
```

### Sample Entry - Window Positioning Validation
**API Focus:** fin.Window.create(), window.getBounds()
**Issue Pattern:** Windows appear in different positions than specified in manifest options
**Solution Pattern:** Add validation after window creation to verify actual vs intended positioning
**Code Pattern:**
```javascript
const window = await fin.Window.create(options);
const actualBounds = await window.getBounds();
console.log('Intended bounds:', options);
console.log('Actual bounds:', actualBounds);
```
**Reusability:** Applicable to all window creation issues where positioning/sizing is involved
**Reference Added:** api-reference/error-handling.md - window validation section

## Pattern Consolidation Notes

*Use this section to note when multiple similar patterns should be consolidated*

### Patterns to Merge:
- [Note similar patterns that could be combined]

### Patterns to Archive:
- [Note outdated patterns that are no longer relevant]

## Quick Reference Patterns

*Most frequently referenced patterns for quick access*

### Standard Error Handling:
```javascript
try {
  // fin API call
  console.log('Operation successful:', result);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('HERE Core API Error:', error);
  console.error('Error details:', JSON.stringify(error, null, 2));
}
```

### Window Creation with Validation:
```javascript
const windowOptions = {
  name: 'sample-window',
  url: 'http://localhost:3000/content.html',
  defaultWidth: 600,
  defaultHeight: 400,
  autoShow: true
};

try {
  const window = await fin.Window.create(windowOptions);
  const bounds = await window.getBounds();
  console.log('Window created successfully:', bounds);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Window creation failed:', error);
}
```

### Platform Window Creation:
```javascript
try {
  const platformWindow = await fin.Platform.createWindow({
    name: 'platform-window',
    url: 'http://localhost:3000/content.html',
    defaultWidth: 800,
    defaultHeight: 600
  });
  console.log('Platform window created:', platformWindow.identity);
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Platform window creation failed:', error);
}
```

## Usage Instructions

### When to Add Entries:
- Discovered a new API usage pattern
- Found a solution to a recurring technical issue
- Identified a useful debugging approach
- Created a reusable code structure

### Entry Guidelines:
- Focus on technical patterns, not customer specifics
- Include working code examples
- Note which reference files were updated
- Explain reusability for similar issues

### Review Process:
- Monthly review of entries
- Consolidate similar patterns
- Move mature patterns to main reference files
- Archive outdated approaches
