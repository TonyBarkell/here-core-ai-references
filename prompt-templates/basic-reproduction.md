# Basic Reproduction Sample Prompt Template

## Standard AI Prompt for HERE速 Core Container Issues

```
I'm a HERE速 Core Container customer support manager. Please review my reference repository at: https://github.com/TonyBarkell/here-core-ai-references

Create a HERE速 Core Container reproduction sample for [ISSUE_TYPE].

**MANDATORY CLARIFICATION STEP:**
Before creating the sample, ask me to confirm your understanding of:
- Views vs Windows terminology (default: "multiple views" = views within same window)
- Platform API usage expectations
- Any ambiguous technical terms in the issue description
- Expected user interaction flow

**Delivery Format (REQUIRED):**
1. **Primary**: Complete Node.js setup script that creates all files automatically
2. **Secondary**: Individual file artifacts only if requested

**CRITICAL Platform API Requirements:**
- MUST use `providerUrl` (NOT `url`) in platform manifest for custom providers
- Custom provider HTML MUST call `fin.Platform.init()` to initialize platform
- Use `Platform.createWindow()` with layout containing embedded views
- Include HERE Process Manager debugging: https://process-manager.here.io

**Technical Issue Details (Sanitized):**
- Issue Type: [Bug/Feature Request/Query/Problem/Solution Request]
- Severity: [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
- HERE速 Core Version: [SPECIFIC_VERSION or "latest stable"]
- Technical Description: "[ANONYMIZED_TECHNICAL_ISSUE]"
- Expected Behavior: [WHAT_SHOULD_HAPPEN]
- Actual Behavior: [WHAT_IS_HAPPENING]
- APIs Involved: [Platform/Interop/Application/System]

**Privacy Reminder:**
Ensure no customer data, names, or identifying information appears in the sample.
```
